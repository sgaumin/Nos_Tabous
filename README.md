# Nos Tabous
Student IDE Narrative Game project made in 1 month.

You can play the game [here](https://vovoda.itch.io/nos-tabous)

## Pitch
Mathias is 40 years old.
He doesn't like his wife. He doesn't like his parents. He doesn't like himself.

Locked behind his taboos, he can't manage to express his feelings.

You will be tasked to guide him through his intricate relationships with his relatives. Maybe by learning more about his root will you be able to break the silence ?

# Getting Started
You can download the project and open it on your local machine with Unity 2018.3
